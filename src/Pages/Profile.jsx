We are responsible for running a range of events, ensuring the target audience is engaged and the message of the event is marketed properly. Events play a huge part in the success of a brand or an organization. <br />

                        As an event manager, we organize Festivals, Parades, Carnivals and Fairs, Cultural Celebrations, Fundraisers and Charity Galas, 
                        Blood Donation Program etc. <br />

                        Our manager commits the whole process from the planning stage, right through to running the event and carrying out the post-event evaluation. The role is primarily hands-on and often involves working as part of a team</p>
